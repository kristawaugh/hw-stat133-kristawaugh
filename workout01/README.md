# gsw-shot-charts
In this report I will visualize shot data from NBA players, specifically the Golden State Warriors.

The purpose of this report is to take a closer look at shooting success rates, while keeping in mind the business of basketball, not just the game. Earlier in the semester, my class (Stat 133 at UC Berkeley) discussed the “cost per point” factor of players. To do this, I analyzed shooting percentages of five of the Warriors top players, their salaries, and visualized their shots.
